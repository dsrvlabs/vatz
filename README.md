# What is VATZ?

**VATZ** is a tool for building, analyzing, and managing blockchain node infrastructure safely and efficiently. You can set up **VATZ** to manage existing or new blockchain nodes and integrate with popular services like PagerDuty, Discord, or Telegram as well as custom in-house solutions.

## How does VATZ Project work?

This project is primarily designed to check node states in real time and receive alert notifications for all blockchain protocols, including metrics that the protocol itself might not support.

To this end, it consists of 3 components:

1. **VATZ-Proto**: API specification for VATZ (SVC) and VATZ Plugins that implements protobuf allowing users to develop in the language they wish.
2. **VATZ (SVC)**: Service that executes plugin APIs based on configs, checks plugin health, and sends notifications to configured channels.
3. **VATZ** **Plugins (with SDK)**: Plugins that integrate with VATZ to support features like node status checks, metric collection, and command execution.

For further information, check [VATZ Project Design](docs/design.md)


## What is the key feature of **VATZ Project**?

### Multi-Protocol Support
Any protocol can be managed through **VATZ** with plugins. Even unsupported protocols can be integrated through simple plugin development.

### Infrastructure as Code
**VATZ** is described using a high-level configuration syntax. You can divide your plugins into modular components that can then be combined in different ways to behave through automation. 

### Monitoring
Various logs and node data are collected and exported by a node exporter, then monitored through the 3rd party applications like Grafana. 

### Data Analysis
**VATZ** helps build datasets for your protocols, and transfer your data into popular services like Prometheus, Kafka, Google BigQuery, and more. In this way, **VATZ** aims to optimize your node infrastructure, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure. (Exp. 2023-Q3)

### Change Automation
Complex node operation tasks can be executed through **VATZ** with minimal human interaction. (Exp. 2023-Q4)

# Our Mission
We're on a mission to both transform the way people experience blockchain technology, and help them shape it. 
As validators, we provide tools for low-cost and low-effort node management for anyone wanting to onboard next-generation blockchain technology.
