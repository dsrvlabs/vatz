## 1. About VATZ ##

> **VATZ** is a tool for building, analyzing, and managing blockchain Node infrastructure safely and efficiently. You can set up VATZ to manage existing or new blockchain nodes and integrate with popular services PagerDuty, Discord, and more as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of **VATZ** are:

- `Multi Protocol Support`: **VATZ** is NOT limited Protocol Type where it categorizes on chain protocol. Any Protocol can be managed through VATZ with plugins, even unsupported protocols can be integrated through simple plugin development.
- `Infrastructure as Code`: **VATZ** is described using a high-level configuration syntax. You can divide your plugins into modular components that can then be combined in different ways to behave through automation.
- `Data Analysis`: **VATZ** helps to build datasets for your managing protocols and transfer your data into popular services Prometheus, Kafaka, Google BigQuery and more. Because of this, VATZ aims to set your Node infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure. (2023-Q3)
- `Change automation`: Complex sets of node's operational tasks can be done through **VATZ** with minimal human interaction. (2023-Q2)
