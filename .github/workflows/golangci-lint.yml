name: Golang Linter
# Lint runs golangci-lint over the entire vatz repository.
#
# This workflow is run on every pull request and push to main.
#
# The `golangci` job will pass without running if no *.{go, mod, sum}
# files have been modified.
#
# To run this locally, simply run `golangci-lint run` from the root of the repo.
