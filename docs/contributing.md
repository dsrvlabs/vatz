### 1.2. Assign assignee
- Voluntary
  Anyone in the team can assign yourself if they want to do certain tasks.

  - Go over with everyone on Vatz bi-weekly meeting to ask help to Validator team. 
  - Switch the assignee through meeting or request. 

### 1.3. Processing assigned issues during the Sprints
> Validator Team's ultimate existence reasons are
- Maximizing uptime
- Following up managed schedule per protocols (binary updates, new spork, epoch, vote, etc)
- Contributing as validator to boost protocol if there's any further improvements are available.

1. At least 1 to 2 issues has to be addressed within a Sprint(two weeks).
2. Assignee has to finish assigned or selected issue as much as possible, leave a comment if it can't be finished within sprint.
3. As Validator team's main task is node operation and therefore leave issue handling to each member's own will. 
   Close the issue, re-register and change to other assignee if it is difficult to proceed during the 2 sprints(4 weeks).
